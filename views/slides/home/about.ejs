                        <p>On September 25th 2015, countries adopted a set of goals to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda.</p>
                        <p>NOVUS SUMMIT, is where technology meets humanity to transform the world. Every year we will honor 17 innovators at the UN that bring together those two worlds and create actionable change.</p>
                        <p>The Summit serves as an intergenerational platform to inspire all generations to unite in action for positive humanitarian impact, and find ways to promote the 2030 mandate by sharing stories of transformation and resilience in a highly immersive environment.</p>
